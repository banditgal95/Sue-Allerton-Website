        <p>
            I came up with the idea for the 'A Tale Of The Gods' series because I love</br>
            Greek mythology and I wanted to give it a modern spin while sticking with</br>
            the characters that we know so well.</br>
            I decided to follow the story of Eris, The Goddess of Discord.</br>
            and a human man named Axle; he was a fun character for me to write,</br>
            As well as all the difficulties in his own life, he has to deal with</br>
            the realisation that perhaps all the myths and legends are true.</br>
        </br>
            Eris was also fun for me to write with. I can follow so many different paths</br>
            with her and essentially change how we percieve certain things about the Myths.</br>
        </br>
            This was the first book I finished completely. I am happy with the result and I</br>
            aware of some errors within the text which I am going through and editing.</br>
            When I finished writing the book I was so excited to get it out there that I</br>
            skipped the editting stage...rookie mistake.</br>
        </br>
        I hope you enjoy following Axle and Eris through this adventure in </br>
        book 1: Hell's Rising, and book 2: Descended.

                        In a world of uncertainty, one thing we can always be sure of is</br> 
                        our thirst for the unknown. Our hope to find just a slither of</br> 
                        fantasy in this dull world is what drives us. </br>
                        As a young historian, Axel is forever searching for clues into the past;</br>
                        he craves the truth behind the stories and rumours that have been passed</br>
                        through time for generations. But when he finds out the answers to his questions,</br> 
                        will he be ready?
                </p>

                <p>
                        The fight continues for Axel as he struggles to come to grips with the world he</br>
                        lives in. Will he be able to come to terms with his new life or will he give</br> 
                        everything up to go back to the world he once knew, but first; he'll need to figure</br> 
                        out how to get back there.
