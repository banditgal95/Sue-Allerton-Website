        <p>
            I started writing when I was a child, I loved transporting myself to new worlds,</br>
            and being the only one able to create the rules there. I guess that's what all </br>
            children want; to be able to create their own rules.</br>
            </br>
            My Chosen genre, over all else; has to be fantasy. Purely for the reason that</br>
            I get to create my own worlds, rules, species. I can make the sky purple and </br>
            it wouldn't matter because it's <em>my</em> world. </br>
            </br>
            It did take me a while to get into my stride. I have the attention span of my </br>
            dog...which, trust me; doesn't last long. I found I was getting bored of my own</br>
            writing, which made me think; if I'm bored just <em>writing</em> this, who is actually</br>
            going to want to read this?</br>
            </br>
            It wasn't until my late teens when I actually wrote a book from start to finish without</br>
            getting bored once. I was so proud of myself just for that alone.</br>
            After that it was pretty straight forward, I made a cover and published with Amazon Kindle.</br>
            I didn't feel like the traditional publishing route was for me, and in all honesty;</br>
            I didn't even try to get published by a publishing house. I enjoy the freedom of</br> 
            self-publishing and it's so easy to do.
