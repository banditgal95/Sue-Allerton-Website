                So in this page I wanted to keep you updated about what will be coming up.</br>
                I am still working on the 'A Tale Of The Gods' series, but I'm yet to find</br>
                inspiration for the third installment, I want it to be the best it can be</br>
                for you guys and I am getting some good ideas while wanting to explor the</br>
                 characters in more detail, I think you'll be surprised with some of the twists.</br>
                Although whereas I would love to get my main series out quicker, I do have</br>
                other ideas I'm currently exploring, both very different which I think will</br>
                vary the audience as they will both be suited to very different readers I think.</br>
                Both of which I'm very excited for, I hope you'll enjoy reading them as much as I'm</br>
                enjoying writing them.
                </br>

            <div class="titles"       
                <p>
                I haven't actually decided on a title for either of these books yet, but this one</br>
                I've been calling 'Willow Creek'</br>
                I wrote this book because it's something I'm so passionate about, it's something</br>
                I've done since I was a kid, other than writing; it's based around horses.</br>
                This isn't something I've ever written about before so I am happy with how it's</br>
                turning out. It's a different genre for me to explore which I am loving right now.</br>
                I've decided to base it on the harshness, and the love; of competitive riding.</br>
                The effects that it can have on both horse and rider and how different sports</br>
                demand different things. I wanted to focus very much on the bond between horse</br>
                and rider.
                </br>
                </br>
                Again, I haven't decided on the title for this one but I've been calling it</br>
                'Underworld'. This one goes back to my favourite genre being fantasy.</br>
                It's slightly darker than the 'A Tale Of The Gods' series and again, based on</br>
                religion. But more the Christian side of things. I wanted to write about Angels</br>
                And Demons. What if we got the stories were true? What if they were wrong?</br>
